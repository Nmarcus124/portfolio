# Nathaniel (Nati) Marcus' Portfolio

Hi, my name is Nati Marcus. I am a data scientist who enjoys solving logical and mathematical puzzles that enable me to get a glimpse of the true nature of our world. Passionate about data science’s ability to create and reveal meaningful insights for a multitude of diverse audiences, I want to help companies use data to facilitate society’s progression towards a more equitable reality.

Included in this repo are three projects I completed as part of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive Course. If you have any questions or want to reach out to me about any of these projects, feel free to message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathaniel-marcus/).
